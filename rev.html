<h3> Top 5 Best Eats </h3>
<div class="one">
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/tsurutontan-udon-noodle-brasserie-new-york?osq=tsurutontan" target="_blank">Tsurutontan Udon Noodle Brasserie</a>
<p> My all time favorite udon place. Highly recommend going during lunch (12pm-3pm) for their lunch specials which are a lot cheaper. Each set comes with a huge, when I say huge  I mean HUGE, bowl of udon with a side of sushi. It is the most flavorful and memorable soup and it makes you feel so warm instead. It's around $25 give or take, but it is worth it for the amount of food they give you.</p>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/zhang-liang-hot-pot-flushing-2" target="_blank">Zhang Liang Dry Pot</a>
<p> One of the BEST dry pots in nyc! I got the lamb dry pot with extra spice (wasn’t spicy at all) and it was big enough with two. If you want the extra mala flavor, request extra extra extra spice, trust me. They also sold boba too!!! The dry pot flavor with the orange fruit tea I got paired perfectly and I only spent less than $20. </p>
<p>66 Mott St, New York, NY 10013</p>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/xian-famous-foods-brooklyn-10" target="_blank">Xi'an Famous Foods</a>
<p> I’ve been craving asian food and this place is amazing. I am obsessed with the liang pi cold skin noodles and the spicy cumin lamb hand-ripped noodles. It reminds me so much of home and it’s just so flavorful and filling. For around $12-15, they give you a big portion and it’s definitely worth the trip.</p>
<p>54 Willoughby St, Brooklyn, NY 11201</p>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=joes+shanghai" target="_blank">Joe's Shanghai</a>
<p> If you’re a big fan of soup dumplings, this is the place to go. They have one of the biggest/juiciest soup dumplings. I ordered the pork soup dumplings and each serving had 8 of them!! SO WORTH IT for only $10.</p>
<p>46 Bowery, New York, NY 10013</p>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hi-collar-new-york-2" target="_blank">Hi Collar</a>
<p> This is a traditional Japanese coffee and tea house and the options all looked so good. Honestly had trouble choosing what to eat. We ended up ordering the mentai cream pasta and the hot cakes. The cream pasta was one of the best pastas I’ve ever had, but the portion was a little small. Hot cakes were also amazing, so soft and buttery. Both around $12 so definitely affordable!.</p>

<h3> Top 5 Best Boba Spots </h3>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiftylan-washington-square-park-new-york-7?osq=fiftylan" target="_blank">FiftyLan</a>
<p> Their golden bubble milk tea and peach yakult tea are top tier. Whenever I’m near Washington Square Park, I always make a trip to get myself a drink. Their large is very large and small is very small. Price wise, very expensive, it’s definitely on the pricier side ($7+), so I usually get a large after I accomplish something.</p>
<p>189 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012</p>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/xing-fu-tang-new-york" target="_blank">Xing Fu Tang</a>
<p> Their strawberry boba milk tea is perfect. It has the perfect blend of strawberry and milk and it tastes like summer. They make their own boba and also have milk tea soft serve, but don’t go towards the night because that’s when they run out/the machine starts breaking. Definitely really good, but also very pricy for a small size (only one size). </p>
<p>133 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003</p>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/tiger-sugar-new-york" target="_blank">Tiger Sugar</a>
<p> Most known for their black sugar milk teas, but I love their mango sago. They only serve it as a large and it’s about $7-8, but the flavor is amazing. </p>
<p>197 Canal St, New York, NY 10013</p>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/m%C3%B6ge-tee-new-york-26?osq=moge+tea" target="_blank">Moge Tea</a>
<p> They have one of the best fruit teas/slush and they usually use fresh fruit. It’s very refreshing and I love getting one after class. Their peach fruit tea is my favorite, but it’s seasonal…..and it’s currently not in season, but besides that, the strawberry one is a top favorite!</p>
<p>69 Cooper Sq, New York, NY 10003</p>

<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/kung-fu-tea-new-york-35?osq=kung+fu+tea" target="_blank">Kung Fu Tea</a>
<p> One of my favorite affordable boba places! I’m a huge fan of their oolong milk tea and I’m very specific with how oolong milk teas should taste and they do it best. They have a huge variety of options and I highly recommend!</p>
